*I am enthusiastic about sharing my experience working on the 'Couple Resort' project as part of my Final Integrated Project (FIP). This endeavor was a captivating exploration into the realm of hospitality and design, where I aimed to create an idyllic retreat tailored specifically for couples. From conceptualization to execution, the project involved meticulous planning and attention to detail. Designing intimate spaces, crafting serene landscapes, and curating an atmosphere conducive to relaxation and connection were central to the project's objectives. The 'Couple Resort' project not only honed my skills in architectural and interior design but also provided a platform to integrate my creative vision with the functional needs of a resort catering to couples. It was a rewarding journey that allowed me to showcase my passion for creating environments that foster love, tranquility, and unforgettable experiences.*

**<u>About:</u>**
I'm a person who embodies a delightful blend of fun-loving and occasionally shy qualities, wrapped in a deep sense of love and affection. I thrive in moments of joy, always ready to share laughter and create cherished memories with friends and loved ones. Yet, there are times when my introverted side shines through, making me a bit reserved and reflective. This shyness allows me to appreciate the quiet moments and introspection that are equally important in life. Above all, love is at the core of my being. I love deeply, whether it's for family, friends, or the world around me. This love fuels my compassion, empathy, and willingness to connect with others on a profound level. It's this combination of fun-loving spirit, occasional shyness, and boundless love that shapes the unique and caring individual that I am.
